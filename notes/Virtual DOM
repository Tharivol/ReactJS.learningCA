In React, for every DOM object, there is a corresponding "virtual DOM object." A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object, like a lightweight copy.

A virtual DOM object has the same properties as a real DOM object, but it lacks the real thing's power to directly change what's on the screen.

Manipulating the DOM is slow. Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster, because nothing gets drawn onscreen. Think of manipulating the virtual DOM as editing a blueprint, as opposed to moving rooms in an actual house.

In summary, here's what happens when you try to update the DOM in React:

	1) 	The entire virtual DOM gets updated.
	2)	The virtual DOM gets compared to what it looked like before you updated it. 			React figures out which objects have changed.
	3)	The changed objects, and the changed objects only, get updated on the real DOM.
	4) 	Changes on the real DOM cause the screen to change.
