ReactDOM——————Javascript Library—Contains React specific methods

ReactDOM.render(	)
	ReactDOM.render is the most common way to render JSX. It takes a JSX expression, creates a 
		corresponding tree of DOM nodes, and adds that tree to the DOM. That is the way to make a JSX
 		expression appear onscreen.	


 ReactDOM.render only updates DOM elements that have changed.
 Only updating the necessary DOM elements is a large part of what makes React successful.
 	***This works because of the virtual DOM***
